I am so grateful to work with Ahmed, in whom I found all the enthusiasm I could not find in anyone else, and his ability to learn and adapt quickly and effectively.
I was also drawn to his ability to adequately analyze the problems he encounters, then think of the most appropriate ways to solve that problem, present his solutions to his colleagues, and ultimately choose the best solution.
Ahmed is an intelligent person, thinks about problems logically, and is very good at learning new things and concepts quickly.
